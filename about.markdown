     PROFILE 
     </div>
     <div class="section-details">
     I'm an Accelerator Operator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. It's a very unique position where we work shifts around the clock in a group setting of 4 to 5 operators per crew. Beam operations require all the magnets, electronic systems, radio frequency systems, cryogenic systems, network computing systems, and many more to work harmonically with each other. For that reason, these systems are attended and tuned continuously by accelerator operators, ensuring beam's optimal efficiency for particle physics research data. We also coordinate with subject-matter experts for troubleshootings of critical issues. In this role, I’ve obtained fundamental knowledge and skills across the diverse systems essential for beam delivery in the Fermilab complex's unique anatomy. Motivated by my interest in computing systems and my relevant experiences, I’m determined to pursue an advanced degree in CS, which will provide me the specialized knowledge and bring me closer to opportunities that use my technical experiences at a more complex level.
