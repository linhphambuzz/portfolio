Advent of Code (AOC) was brought to my attention from a message on the slack channel of Fermilab's coding club back when I was still an intern there. Coming from a non-CS background, data structures and algorithm is not a class that's included in my coursework. Solving AOC problems to me was a very fun, productive way that I can learn the fundamental while slowing walking to the more complex ones.  

I have a github repository with a README that categorized topics of what I learned coding through the problems:
