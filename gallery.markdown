## MOOC certificates 
<h2> <strong> Survey radiation with Boston Dynamics SPOT robot</strong></h2>

- Early on in my career at Fermilab, I join the Robotic Initiative where I take on a project to take SPOT into the beam enclosure to measure beam dose radiation. 
- I write Python scipts to acquire SPOT's localization data, and obtain the radiation dose reading based off of SPOT's location: [github repo](https://github.com/fermilab-robotics/SPOT-LSM-survey)

- What did I learn ? 
  - <strong> Python Object Oriented Programming </strong> : the entire project includes multitudes of classes. I choose abstract class for this project because there are repetitive methods that needs to be implemented. 
  - <strong> Docker </strong>: I like the idea of developing inside a container for consistency. Later on, I incorporate docker-compose into the project, because volume mounting is very convinient for debugging and testing code. 







<h2> <strong> Computational Modeling of Disordered Solids Summer School</strong> </h2>

Summer of 2019, my junior year of college, I was selected to participate in a one-week workshop for computational modeling that targets Physics undergraduate and graduate students who're interested in computing for physics research. This is hosted by the University of Southern Missisipi.

This workshop is where I first got introduced to <strong>Python</strong> and Linux Bash scripting. I was also granted a Linux computer at the end. And just like that, my coding journey starts! 

<h2> <strong> Fermilab Internship  </strong> </h2>

Summer of 2020, I interned at Fermilab working on a reconstruction project to evaluate models used for cross-section measurements of Neutrino- Argon interactions. 

I was introduced to [ROOT, a C++ framework from CERN](https://root.cern/) to analyze generated data. I learn about Object Orirented Programming in C++, and gain substantial knowledge about memory allocating for low level language programming.

The presentation of this project at the Gulf Coast Undergraduate got me the first prize in the Physics panel! 


<h2><strong> What did I learn in college?</strong></h2>

Programming courses that I took during my undergraduate studies: 

- Programing for Scientist and Enginners: basic of programming in <strong> C </strong> 
- Object Oriented Programming in <strong>Java</strong>: I asked to audit this course.
    - Core concepts of OOPs: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. 
    - Software designs: Factory, Singleton, Facade, etc. 
- Computational Physics: [gihub repository](https://github.com/linhphambuzz/NumericalMethod)
    - Numerical Methods technique in <strong> Python </strong>
